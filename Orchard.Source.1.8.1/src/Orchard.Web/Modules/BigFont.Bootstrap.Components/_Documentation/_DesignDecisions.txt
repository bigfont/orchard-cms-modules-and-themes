Implement the bootstrap components with alterates and classes not lessc mixins, because using mixins leads to css duplication.

Use the @Bootstrap extension class, because then it's clear when we're using Bootstrap in views.

Use a resource manifest with Bootstrap JS and CSS, because this lets other modules/themes use the resources and might prevent linking them twice.
