# Must Have

- Hide or do something appropriate with the control on small devices, because it looks nasty.

- Fix the toggle sync bugs or remove them, because that functionality is broken.

- Change theme activation to theme tracing, because the latter is session not application in scope. Done.

# Should Have

- Position the Current Theme selector more subtly, because it currently blocks a lot of the UI. Done.

- Add a way to toggle tracing. Done.

- Specify that it shows "main structural classes and id" not just "classes and ids"

# Nice to Have

- Make the background color (and border) the same as in the shape tracing background UI.

- Align the control vertically in the middle.
