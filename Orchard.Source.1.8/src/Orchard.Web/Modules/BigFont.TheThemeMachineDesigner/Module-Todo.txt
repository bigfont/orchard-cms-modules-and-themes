# Must Have

- Give a fixed height to the class-and-id annotations, because sometimes the bottom text is hidden.

- Hide or do something appropriate with the control on small devices, because it looks nasty. Done.
- Fix the toggle sync bugs or remove them, because that functionality is broken. Done.
- Change theme activation to theme tracing, because the latter is session not application in scope. Done.

# Should Have

- Make the control bar dragable because it sometimes gets in the way.

- Remove the absolute positioning from the layout-wrapper:before, because it currenlty looks funny (keep the high z-index, though).

- Run the super theme recipe from this module rather than from setup.

- Enable drag and drop of the control bar, because sometimes it gets in the way.

- List all themes that inherit from TheThemeMachine. Won't do.
- Enhace the topography to show ALL layers including widgets and zones. Done.
- Show all ids and classes below #layout-wrapper. Done.
- Position the Current Theme selector more subtly, because it currently blocks a lot of the UI. Done.
- Add a way to toggle tracing. Done.
- Specify that it shows "main structural classes and id" not just "classes and ids".  Done.

# Nice to Have

- Add the ability to add and remove zones with a click. 

- Add the ability to add and remove widgets with a click. 

- Add the name of the current theme to the Orchard title.

- Remove what might be unecessary !important css properties, because this is poor form.

- Make the background color (and border) the same as in the shape tracing background UI.

- Align the control vertically in the middle. Done.
