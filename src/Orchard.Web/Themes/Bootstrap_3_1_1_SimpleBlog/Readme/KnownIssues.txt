# Windows Phone 8 Horizontal Scroll Bar

On Windows Phone 8 htc, if we rotate from portrait to landscape, we get a horizontal scroll bar.  
 
 - We have the metas

	<meta content="IE=edge" http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" />
    <meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" name="viewport" />

 - This only happens on rotate from portrait to landscape. 
 - It does not happen if we start in landscape on a page load nor if we do a page refresh in landscape.
 - It does not happen when we rotate using web developer tools in FireFox.
